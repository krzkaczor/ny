  <h2 align="center">ðŸ—½ NY - Fast, Proxy Package Manager for JavaScript</h2>
  <h4 align="center">Chooses the right package manager or runtime based on the lockfile.</h3>
  <p align="center"><i><strong>n</strong></i>ode â€¢ <i><strong>y</strong></i>arn â€¢ pnpm â€¢ bun</p>
</p>

## Features

- <strong>Universal</strong> - Picks the right package manager/runtime based on the lockfile. `npm`, `bun`, `pnpm`, `yarn` - we got you covered!
- <strong>Versatile</strong> - Handles the basics like installing all your dependencies, adding new packages, and kicking off scripts.
- <strong>Speedy</strong> - Crafted in Rust to give you a quick ride. When running scripts, it's actually faster than using PMs directly!
- <strong>TypeScript-Ready</strong> - Adding a new dependency? Don't worry! It'll fetch any missing `@types` packages for you if needed.

## Usage

```sh
ny # installs all dependencies eq. to: yarn install
```

```sh
ny add zod # installs zod package eq. to: yarn add zod
```

```sh
ny test # executes package.json's test script eq. to: yarn test
```

```sh
ny vitest # executes node_modules/.bin binary eq. to: yarn vitest
```

## Installation

### Install script

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krzkaczor/ny/main/install.sh | bash
```

## CLI

For full documentation run `ny --help`.

- `ny install` - trigger installing all dependencies. Aliased to: `ny`.
- `ny add package` - add new dependency, supports flags like `--dev` and `--workspace-root`. Will automatically install missing TypeScript `@types` packages.
- `ny run task` - runs a task with a given name or resolves a JS file in `node_modules/bin`. Will use node.js to execute it by default unless bun lockfile is present. Aliased to: `ny task`.

## Dive deeper

### Motivation

In the world of JavaScript, there's a fun mix of package managers - npm, yarn, pnpm. Pick your poison. With a rise of alternative runtimes like Bun or Deno the problem only gets worse. Programmers often switch between projects that use different PMs multiple times a day. Did you just typed `npm` when the project uses `bun`? Well too bad -- you've wasted couple of seconds again. With ðŸ—½NY, there's no guesswork. Just type `ny` and it picks the right manager and runtime for you. Handy, right?

And here's the kicker: ðŸ—½NY is faster! Especially when running package scripts (like when you type `yarn test`). It's written in Rust and it zips through tasks about ~200ms faster by avoiding spawning node processes just to parse `package.json`. Sweet, huh?

Main sources of inspiration were [antfu/ni](https://github.com/antfu/ni) (but it's written in JS) and [egoist/dum](https://github.com/egoist/dum) (but it's only a task runner).

### TypeScript support

If `ny` detects that it's running in TypeScript enabled package, it will attempt to install missing typings when adding new packages. Right now this behaviour can't be turned off.

### Logo

Logo should depict a statue of liberty (a symbol of <strong>N</strong>ew <strong>Y</strong>ork ;) ) holding tools. Midjourney prompt goes something like: `simple mascot, statue of liberty holding tools, pixelart style`. Later [vectorizer.ai](https://vectorizer.ai) was used to get SVG out of bitmap.

I know it's not perfect and if you figure out a better prompt let me know!
