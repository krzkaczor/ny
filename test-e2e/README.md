# test-e2e

Additional E2E tests for `ny`. Run `ny` binary and test its output.

In directories with different PMs having at least one dependency was required so lockfiles exist (we use lockfiles to differentiate between PMs).

This is a first iteration of e2e testing harness. Expect things to change.
